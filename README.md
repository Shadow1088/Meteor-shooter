(s) for START if in MENU

(e) for EXIT if in MENU

(esc) for SETTINGS (! will lose points, upgrades, ..)

while in SETTINGS
	you can press Enter to select the setting you want to change.
         For that use Arrows (<- / ->)
	  if used Arrow_down / Arrow_up selected setting is either the one above / under previous
	Mouse can also be used.

Window_setting is not usable / not compatible with this version of the game. (Not gonna be finished)

Share and use this game as you like. (I did code it all by myself, but the idea and 1/3 graphics are inspired by Christian Koch on Udemy)
